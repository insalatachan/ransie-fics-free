<p class="p1"><em>I'll kill him.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>I'll kill that bastard.</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Even if it means I have to die trying, I'll kill him.</em></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">A mantra. Felix repeats those phrases in his mind over and over again, without pause or respite. It would have been better not to remember what happened hours ago in that same cell, yet the memories remain exactly where they belong even when the drug's effect has worn off. Is it a blessing? Or a curse? Felix oscillates between the two, unable to decide. Being unaware of the violence he suffered would make him more docile, but remembering it... remembering it makes him more lethal. And so be it. He's collecting quite a few bruises, but let them be arrows in his quiver, at least.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Breathe, slowly.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The thought turns to the sharp bone hidden in his pillow. Should he keep it in his pocket and attack Hyunjin at the first opportunity? Fuck, he'd like to. He'd like to impale him in the throat and watch him bleed out, see him take his last breath. But is it the right time? No, it's not. He's blinded by rage and anger and wouldn't come out of it well. He's not lucid enough to think of a plan, and since it's his only chance, he can't afford to waste it.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe he should be accommodating. For as much as it disgusts him the idea of licking that bastard's ass, it might be a good thing to push him to trust him, to underestimate him even. Only when he thinks he has him under his thumb, then Felix can act. And God, he'll enjoy the moment.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The lock clicks three times. The heavy door opens and closes. Then, footsteps.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix tries to wipe that grim expression off his face. He lowers his head, breathes slowly. The idea of having to look at Hyunjin's eyes again after what happened... he can still taste him in his mouth, still feel his cock thrusting into his throat without any mercy. <em>Bastard.</em></p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Hey."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Hyunjin's voice is clear. It has nothing in common with the mocking tone he used during the live stream, when he had that ridiculous Scream mask over his face. Felix doesn't lift his head yet. He feels vulnerable, like a wounded animal abandoned on the side of the road.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Are you okay?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">No response.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"I brought you something warm. Some ramyeon &mdash; homemade, no chemical crap."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix snorts, amused. <em>Damn</em>. Did he have to get imprisoned by a psychopath to finally eat some non-instant ramyeon?</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix remembers that earning Hyunjin's trust means lowering a few protective walls. So, even though he wants to jump at his throat, it&rsquo;s better to seem harmless. Easier said than done. When he pushes himself up from the ground, Felix feels as heavy as if he weighed three hundred pounds.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"I know it wasn&rsquo;t easy, but you did well. It&rsquo;ll be a while before the next live stream."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix lifts his head. He meets Hyunjin&rsquo;s gaze for a moment, then looks away. He moves toward the bars.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"I'm really hungry," he says.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Hyunjin looks at him, and for the first time, he can&rsquo;t seem to read Felix. He pulls out a thermos and a bowl, pouring the contents into it. The ramyeon is steaming hot. He hands Felix some chopsticks to eat with.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix takes the bowl in his hands and sits cross-legged by the bars. He blows on the broth, then slowly starts eating the noodles. It&rsquo;s good, slightly spicy, and has a strong soy flavor &mdash; just the way he likes it. In a way, it reminds him of the ramyeon his grandmother used to make for him when he was little. She always cut a little piece of ginger into the shape of a bunny, saying whoever found it in their bowl would be kissed by good luck.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"I&rsquo;ll get you a bed with a mattress. And some books, too. Is there something you&rsquo;d like to read?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix picks up a piece of meat. From the color and texture, he guesses it&rsquo;s duck. He chews it slowly, thinking about how to respond to that question. "Don&rsquo;t you think I could ask for something that might help me get out of here?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Not even <em>Escape from Alcatraz</em> would help you," Hyunjin chuckles.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Are we on an island in the middle of the Pacific?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Could be," Hyunjin says.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Nah, I doubt it. It&rsquo;s freezing in here, and it&rsquo;s disgustingly damp."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Do you think it&rsquo;d make a difference if you knew where you were?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"I already know where I am. I&rsquo;m in Seoul. Definitely," Felix adds. He has no actual proof to support his theory, but why would anyone bother taking him to another country? Especially considering all the risks involved during the &ldquo;transfer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Why did you come back? To Seoul, I mean."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix shrugs. He grabs some pak choi with the chopsticks. "I don&rsquo;t know. I wanted to rediscover my roots, I guess."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"And did you?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix lets out a sarcastic snort. "Yeah, sure. I&rsquo;m making a lot of progress locked up in here."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Don't you think there are some positives to this situation?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Don&rsquo;t fuck with me," Felix grumbles.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"I'm serious."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"So am I. I&rsquo;m dead serious."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Think about it. You don't have to deal drugs on the streets like a desperate man anymore, or eat junk to stay alive. You don't have the stress of paying bills, or people hunting you down for debts you can&rsquo;t pay."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Oh wow, that&rsquo;s fantastic. Too bad you're probably a lackey for one of those bastards I owe money to, and you're making them profit by practically forcing me into prostitution. Huge improvement."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"I have nothing to do with those people," Hyunjin says sharply. His tone almost sounds offended. Felix finds it incredibly ironic that he&rsquo;d get sensitive, given their circumstances.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"For all I know, you're lying. I know nothing about you, Hyunjin. Like you said before, I don&rsquo;t even know where the fuck we are. I don&rsquo;t know if this bowl of ramyeon is poisoned or not, yet I&rsquo;m still eating it because I'm starving and have no idea when I'll get my next meal."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Hyunjin stays silent. He doesn&rsquo;t speak for so long that Felix thinks he might leave, but he stays. It feels like an eternity before Hyunjin speaks again: "Playing the victim suits you."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Fuck off. I&rsquo;m in a situation where I can afford to."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Don't you think you brought yourself to this cage? Maybe if your karma wasn&rsquo;t so fucked&mdash;"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Shut up! If you're gonna blame me for my misery, you can just climb those damn stairs and leave!"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Hyunjin falls silent again, but then he laughs. "You think you can give me orders?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Shit. And to think Felix was supposed to make friends with him. The problem is, Felix is too honest, too real to wear a mask and play a role that doesn&rsquo;t suit him. Earning Hyunjin's trust is going to be fucking hard.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"No, of course I can&rsquo;t. And I wouldn&rsquo;t &mdash; I don&rsquo;t want to fight, or be angry all the time, but you're provoking me, and I&rsquo;m tired, literally exhausted."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">At that point, Hyunjin sits on the floor, cross-legged. Felix realizes that it's been a while since he&rsquo;s seen Hyunjin in his police uniform &mdash; the cheap costume he was using to try and fool him, that is.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Not wearing your cosplay anymore?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"No point, since I was found out."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"How do you know I figured it out?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"You're easier to read than you think, Felix."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"That&rsquo;s not an answer," Felix insists, "how did you know?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Damn. If Hyunjin can really read him that well, how long before he discovers the bone hidden in the pillowcase? The thought makes Felix more on edge than it should.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"You touched my badge a few days ago. You were completely out of it, but I saw your expression change. Anyway, you already had doubts that this was a real prison, didn&rsquo;t you?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix says nothing.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, he knew, but having confirmation makes him feel&hellip; terrible.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"How many of you are there here?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"I can&rsquo;t answer that, and you know it."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Are you going to let the others abuse me too?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s strange how Hyunjin almost seems pissed at the idea.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"No one but me will ever lay a finger on you. I guarantee that."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"You're not going to sell me to the men you let watch me?"</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"No," Hyunjin insists. "Don&rsquo;t make me repeat myself."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix remains silent. He sips some broth from the bowl, then takes another sip.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Harry Potter."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Hm?" Hyunjin arches an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">"Bring me the first Harry Potter book. When I was a kid, if I was scared, or angry, or felt sick... I&rsquo;d read the first Harry Potter book and feel better. I&rsquo;d like it if you brought me that book."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Hyunjin scoffs with a laugh. "Holy shit, you really are a kid... Fine. I&rsquo;ll bring you Harry Potter," he says as he gets up from the floor. He brushes the dust off his pants and extends his hands through the bars. "Give me the chopsticks. You can keep the bowl, though."</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s plastic, Felix thinks, that&rsquo;s why he's letting me keep it.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">He hands over the chopsticks, and Hyunjin gives a small wave &mdash; a silent goodbye. He climbs the stairs slowly. The door closes, and the lock clicks three times.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Felix is left alone with his ramyeon. He drinks the soup down to the last drop, then realizes there&rsquo;s a piece of ginger left at the bottom of the bowl. He squints his eyes, rubs them, sure he&rsquo;s seeing wrong. He reaches into the bowl and pulls out the piece of ginger. The bowl slips from his hands in surprise, hitting the ground with a dull thud.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The piece of ginger...</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">...Why the fuck is that piece of ginger shaped like a bunny?</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4"><strong> <em><br /></em> </strong></p>

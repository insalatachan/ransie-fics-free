<p class="p1">When Felix wakes up, the first thing he feels is a splitting headache. He presses his palms to his temples, rubbing them as he squints his eyes. For the first time in what he can't even remember how many days, the lights are dim. No more glaring white neon bearing down on him. That's the first thing he notices. Then, he realizes that his wrists, though marked with red, are free from the cuffs. Finally, he notices he's wearing warm, soft pajamas. There's a pillow and a blanket on the floor.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">He blinks slowly.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin.</p>

<p class="p1">Game.</p>

<p class="p1">Camera.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">A flash cuts through his mind, sharp and painful. His gaze shifts outside the cage. The tripod and GoPro are gone. Felix stands up, moving closer to the bars. The corridor outside his cell is empty and silent. There’s not a single object left behind to give him a clue as to where he is, or why. The only thing he knows is that before he blacked out, that place was brightly lit and Hyunjin was about to film him. But why?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Gentlemen, today we’ll play a game.”</p>

<p class="p1">“The donations…”</p>

<p class="p1">Pleasure. Blinding, terrible pleasure.</p>

<p class="p1">Felix reaches for Hyunjin to kiss him, but Hyunjin pulls back.</p>

<p class="p1">The badge wasn’t real. It was plastic.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix gasps, gripping the bars tightly to keep himself from collapsing. The memories return, chaotic and violent. He distinctly remembers touching Hyunjin's badge and discovering it was plastic, not metal. Proof, without a doubt, that he's not a cop. And if he’s not a cop, this can't be a prison.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Wait... Hyunjin?</p>

<p class="p1">Now he knows his name. Not once had Felix wondered what his captor’s name was or who he really was. It had seemed better to know as little as possible about him. But now, he knows something about him, and from what Felix has learned from movies, that’s never a good thing. The more you know about your kidnapper, the less chance you have of getting out alive. But then again, has there ever been a real chance of getting out of this place alive? Hyunjin has shown his face from the very beginning. That suggests he never planned to let him go.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix laughs nervously. He turns, letting his back slide down the bars until he’s sitting on the floor. What a messed-up situation. He slips a hand into his pants, checking between his legs. No rubber cord. At least that psycho had stopped using him like a doll. He doesn’t remember everything in detail, but something about donations comes to mind. Is Hyunjin selling videos of him for money? For some reason, that seems too simple, too banal considering the surreal situation he’s trapped in. Hyunjin could have done that with a paid escort without committing dozens of crimes.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">It’s unbelievable. He’s been in that cage for days, and the only thing he’s figured out is that this isn’t a state prison at all, but the experiment of a madman. Then again, is he so sure Hyunjin is crazy? Or that he’s acting alone? Or that he’s the one in charge of this? Felix doesn’t know. He has no clue. And asking his captor directly would be as useful as asking the wall in front of him.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">There isn’t much to do in the cage. Giving in to despair might be entertaining for a while, but eventually, even that loses its appeal. Felix stares into the void, his mind silent. In everyday life, he never had so much empty time. In moments like these, when the emptiness fills his head to the point of muting it completely, he starts to doubt his own humanity. How different is he from a monkey trapped in a zoo? This place is too small, too bare. There’s no one to talk to, nothing to read. He’d pay for a magazine, a comic, or better yet, a book. At least for a moment, he could escape. Maybe he could ask Hyunjin to bring him something to read? Yet Felix has no idea how he’d react to that request. And at the same time, he feels that asking for a book would be like accepting his conditions. Like accepting that he’s a prisoner and wanting to fill his new life with nice things to make it more bearable. But Felix isn’t ready to give in yet, to accept it. And deep down, he doesn’t think that moment will ever come.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">He falls asleep and wakes up three times. How long has it been since Hyunjin last came to the cell? It could be days, or it could be hours—Felix has no idea. He leans against the pillow, breathing slowly. He's about to drift off again when the lights suddenly blaze, blinding him. For several minutes, that’s the only change. Felix wonders if the lights run on some sort of timer—maybe they’re bright during the day and dim at night? He had assumed they were always on since he had never seen them as dim as before, but he’s not even sure he’s ever been awake during the night. He doesn’t even know if he’s ever truly slept without the influence of a sedative. For all he knows, his waking moments could just be the times when the drugs stopped working.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">A door opens. Felix listens carefully. Three heavy clicks, four lighter ones. It’s a security door. It closes with a dull thud. It must be thick, maybe soundproof. Not great news. Then, footsteps. Hyunjin is holding a plastic bag. He approaches the cage and looks in Felix's direction. Their eyes meet.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I thought you might be hungry.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">How thoughtful—Felix thinks sarcastically, but he says nothing.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I brought fried chicken and beer.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix turns away. Is he hungry? Starving. The smell of the fried chicken and beer makes his mouth water so intensely that he feels overwhelmed by it. His salivation increases, but he has too much pride to show gratitude. He hates him. There’s no way he could be grateful for something so basic as being brought food by the man who drugs him so often he can’t even remember his last meal.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Felix, you need to eat.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Why the fuck do you care?” Felix snaps suddenly, sitting up. He wishes with all his heart to be submissive—not for Hyunjin, but out of pure survival instinct. And yet, he can't manage it. He’s never hated anyone so much, and that hate radiates from every cell in his body.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Because dead, you’re no use to me. You’d just be a smelly, annoying mess to dispose of.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Christ, you’re disgusting. Do you even hear yourself? Are you human, or what?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Maybe I’m an alien. What do you care? Come here and take the food while I’m still in a good mood, or I swear I’ll give it to the dogs.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Faced with that threat, Felix gives in. He doesn’t want to lose the chance to eat that fried chicken. He moves closer to the cell and stretches his hands out to receive the bag. Hyunjin sits cross-legged outside the bars.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“What do you remember about yesterday?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Enough to know this place isn’t a prison.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin stays silent.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">He extends his hand past the bars. “Pass me a beer.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“You feel like drinking?” Felix asks, digging into the bag. There’s a basket full of breaded chicken legs and four cans of cold beer. The condensation dampens his hands. He passes a can to Hyunjin, who cracks it open and takes a sip.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“What else do you remember?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“You’re not going to say anything? Not going to deny it? Tell me I’m wrong?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“What would be the point? Even a total idiot could figure out this place isn’t a prison.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin takes another sip of beer, and Felix feels stung. It had taken him so long to realize that, huh?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“So, what is this place?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“If I tell you, where’s the fun in that?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Do you really think I can have fun here?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin shrugs. “You might.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix grabs a chicken leg and takes a bite. The crunchy breading, the tender meat, the taste of spicy seasoning—it’s so good that his mouth waters even more. He chews, then shakes his head. “I might? Do you realize I’ve been sleeping on the floor for a week?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“What makes you think you’ve been here for a week?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Honestly? I don’t have a fucking clue.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Yeah, but why did you say it?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I don’t know. I can’t keep track of how many times I’ve woken up in this cell because I’m always out of it.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“That’s because of the drugs.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Yeah.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Yesterday, you asked me for a dose,” Hyunjin points out.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Yesterday, you wanted me to have an orgasm in front of a bunch of perverts."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Touché. Do you want to know how long you’ve been here?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Yeah. It’s not something I can figure out just by thinking about it.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin takes another sip of beer, his gaze fixed on Felix, serious. Felix raises an eyebrow.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“What now?” he asks, but Hyunjin stays silent for another dozen seconds before speaking.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“You’ve been here for a month, Felix.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">What?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">A month?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">It can’t be true.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix freezes. The chicken bone slips from his hand and hits the floor. His fingers start to tremble. A month? He doesn’t know what scares him more—the fact that he’s been imprisoned for that long, or that he only remembers a handful of days in this cell.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“How much did you drug me? I—I don’t have any memories of most of the days I’ve been here,” he tries to say it calmly, but inside he’s panicking. His ears are ringing, cold sweat breaks out, and nausea hits him hard. He downs a few quick gulps of beer.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“As much as it took to keep you alive.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix blinks slowly.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“What does that mean?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Exactly what I said.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin stands up from the floor. Felix knows the brief moment of peace is over, and with it, their conversation. “If you behave, I’ll get you a mattress.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Behave? What’s the worst I could do? Call you an asshole?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin frowns. “You’d be surprised how much your aggressive language bothers me.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“You’d be surprised how much I don’t give a fuck,” Felix mutters under his breath. Hyunjin hears him but doesn’t respond.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Tomorrow will be a hard day for you.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Jesus. The stick and the carrot again, huh? You bring me fried chicken and beer hoping I’ll take whatever comes next a little better?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Felix, do you realize I don’t have to do this? I’m trying to be human.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix bursts out laughing, then glances around, mocking.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Yeah, because people who claim to be human do exactly this to other people. Why even bother warning me? It’s not like I can do anything about it.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin runs a hand over his face.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“You’d be better off avoiding the drugs. But I understand it might be hard for you to go without, so…”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Just don’t drug me unless you absolutely have to. Tomorrow? Whatever it is, judging by your face, I’m sure it’s necessary.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Sooner or later, we’ll have to do without them, you know.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Maybe I’ll be dead by then,” Felix says. “One can hope.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Enjoy the fried chicken and beer,” Hyunjin replies sharply. Then, he heads toward the stairs, leaving Felix alone again.</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The darkness.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Now that the neon lights are finally off, Felix realizes for the first time how comforting it is, how <em>necessary</em> it is. Human beings, so used to having full control over their surroundings, often overlook how this free will positively affects the rest of their bodies. Felix has learned this the hard way, enduring the glare of artificial light for days on end, with no shadow, no peace for his eyes, no quiet for his mind.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But compliance had brought him the darkness. And then, once again, compliance had brought him a pillow to rest his head on, pajamas to cover his body, and a blanket to keep him warm. </span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Yet these things were nothing compared to what he eventually obtained: a weapon. </span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And the best part? <em>Hyunjin hadn’t even realized he’d handed it to him.</em></span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Enjoy the fried chicken and beer,” his jailer had said, leaving him alone.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix had filled his stomach and then found himself with his leftovers in hand. Suddenly, with nothing else, he realized that those scraps were the only resources he possessed. So, his mind started thinking, and thinking, <em>and thinking</em>.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At first, the idea was to break the can and use the sharp edge as a weapon, but it was too thin, too flexible. Then, he realized that the chicken bone could be easily shaped. It was small enough to hide in his pajama sleeve, hard enough not to break easily, but soft enough to be sharpened. So, in the silence of his cell, Felix spent hours and hours pressing the bone against his palm as he ground it against the rough floor.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And in the end, he succeeded in sharpening it into a weapon.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">That chicken bone had ceased to be waste and had transformed into an opportunity. Now, Felix keeps that opportunity hidden within the padding of his pillow. He knows he must resist the impulse to use this makeshift weapon at the first chance because it’s a card he can only play once. It has to be the perfect moment—so ideal that it will make his escape, if not easy, at least feasible.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">
    <em>“Tomorrow is going to be a tough day for you.”</em>
  </span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Those words echo in Felix’s mind like a dark omen. He’s not ready. Whatever awaits him, he wishes it were far away, distanced by years from today. Although Felix doesn’t know what time it is or how long until tomorrow, he’s well aware that every breath brings him closer to that moment. So, almost instinctively, he tries to slow his breathing as if doing so could delay the inevitable march of time.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">At some point, he falls asleep.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">He slips into a calm, soothing dream. He’s back in his small apartment on the outskirts of Seoul. The kettle is hissing, steam rising from its spout. He tears open a pack of instant ramyeon, something cheap he bought at the local supermarket. It’s junk food, full of chemicals — he should eat better — but with his expenses piling up, the ramyeon fills him enough to forget he's eating nothing but garbage.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Later, he’s lounging on the couch. A drama plays on the TV, night has fallen. He’s about to drift off, suddenly overwhelmed by the fatigue of the day. He turns off the television, and the little red indicator light glows like a watching eye in the dark. Felix stretches when a sound draws his attention — footsteps.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">They come from the hallway outside his apartment. He moves to the door, pressing his eye against the peephole. Someone is there. Their hood is pulled low, and they’re wearing a dark mask. The figure leans closer, and all Felix can see through the peephole is their iris. The eye in his dream swells, becoming so enormous it swallows him whole. The eye watches him. The eye sees him.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix jerks awake, his heart racing in his chest.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The lights are on. Hyunjin stands on the other side of the cage.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Nightmares?"</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix needs a moment to answer. His mind is still rattled by the dream, which is absurd—there’s no way that dream could be more dangerous than the reality he’s in, or that the mysterious figure on the other side of the door had worse intentions than Hyunjin.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix pulls his knees to his chest, resting his forehead against them, breathing slowly. He’s still in the cage. Tomorrow has already arrived.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What is this place?” Felix asks suddenly.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hyunjin seems surprised by the question. He crouches down, pulling a tripod and a GoPro out of a canvas bag he brought with him.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“It’s a cell.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You know that’s not the answer to the question I asked.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You asked what this place is, and I answered. It’s a cell. What else do you think it could be? A palace? A train station?”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t bullshit me,” Felix growls, lifting his gaze, sharp. “I’ve been here for over a month. I have the right to know where I am and why.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hyunjin calmly sets up the tripod and screws the GoPro into place.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You have the *right* to know? You think you’re in a position to claim any rights?”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’re going to keep me in the dark forever?” Felix asks, his voice tight.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Woke up chatty today, didn’t you?”</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">No, of course not. If he had a choice, Felix wouldn’t speak a word to that guy. But it just so happens Hyunjin is the only person with the answers to his questions—and the only person he can have any conversation with. Still, Felix realizes he won’t get much out of Hyunjin today. And probably, Hyunjin will never be fully willing to explain what Felix is experiencing or why.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“There’s going to be another live stream today,” Hyunjin says after a while.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix expected it. He knew it was coming, but tried to suppress the thought until the last moment. It’s degrading, humiliating, and he has no idea what kind of long-term consequences this will have once he gets out. What gets posted on the internet stays there forever, right? That problem, though, seems distant. After all, he’s not even sure he’ll ever leave this cell. Who knows if he’ll ever see the blue sky again or feel the warmth of the sun on his skin. Things he’s taken for granted his whole life, and now he craves.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Did you bring the drugs?” Felix asks.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I did.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Only then does Felix release the blanket he’d been clutching around himself like a mantle and moves closer to the bars. Today, Hyunjin has his hair tied in a low ponytail, with a few strands framing his face. The kind of guy Felix could have fallen in love with if they’d met under different circumstances. It’s terrifying to think about. It’s terrifying to think that outside of this cell, that person has a life. Maybe he even has a girlfriend, oblivious to the fact that her partner is holding someone captive, torturing and humiliating him for money.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix extends his hand beyond the bars, palm up, waiting for the dose. Hyunjin pulls a blister pack from his pants pocket, dropping a white pill into Felix’s waiting hand.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix pulls the blanket tighter around him like a cloak before stepping closer to the bars. Today, Hyunjin's hair is tied in a low ponytail, with a few strands framing his face. Under different circumstances, Felix could have fallen for someone like him. It’s terrifying to even think about it. It’s terrifying to realize that, outside this cell, this person has a life. Maybe he even has a girlfriend, oblivious to the fact that her boyfriend is holding someone captive, torturing and humiliating them for money.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix extends his hand through the bars, palm up, waiting for the dose. Hyunjin reaches into his pocket, pulling out a blister pack and dropping a white pill into Felix’s waiting palm.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I have so many questions in my head. It would be nice to get answers to at least a fraction of them,” Felix sighs, placing the pill on his tongue. Last time, the drug came in liquid form, but now it’s a pill. Maybe it’s something different. Not knowing what he’s taking unnerves him, but once again, nothing seems worse than the situation he’s already in.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I told you—if you behave, you’ll be rewarded. The better you behave, the kinder I’ll be to you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“These live streams, are they part of being ‘kind’ to me?”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“They’re necessary.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Necessary for who?”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Necessary. That’s all,” Hyunjin replies curtly.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix begins to feel the drug clouding his mind. He stumbles forward, his hands gripping the bars for support. “Ugh—strong,” he mumbles.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Yes. The request today is... specific, and though I was hesitant, I decided to increase the dosage. You probably won’t remember anything that happens.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“No—” Felix squeaks, his inhibitions slowly crumbling. His thoughts spill out as they come. “I don’t want to forget—I want to know. I want to know everything.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hyunjin sighs, skeptical. He pulls the key from his pocket and slowly approaches the cell door. “You don’t know what you’re saying. Sometimes forgetting makes things easier. Like your first days here. Would you really want to remember those?”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“They’re my memories!” Felix protests. The door opens, and Hyunjin steps into the cage. Felix’s head spins so violently, he’s sure he’d collapse if he let go of the bars. “They’re mine—you have no right to take them away from me. Good or bad—I need my memories to understand.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Understanding is overrated,” Hyunjin replies. His hands cup Felix’s face, lifting it so their eyes meet. “What’s the point of understanding? Would it give you freedom? Would it make you happy? Sometimes, people are happier staying ignorant.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Understanding would give me hope,” Felix breathes, his hands now gripping Hyunjin’s forearms for support. He clings to him. But Hyunjin’s expression hardens.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Hope? Let it go.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You can’t take it from me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Don’t waste your time hoping to escape this place. What’s the point? There’s no one waiting for you out there.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I don’t need someone waiting for me to hope for freedom.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hyunjin rolls his eyes. “The drug is taking too long to kick in. See why it’s better to lower the dose or stop it entirely? You’re still too lucid.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“Who cares? Lucid or not... I still don’t have a choice.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“That’s true, but today, I need you docile enough not to resist.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix laughs, feeling drunk, like he’s downed an entire bottle of wine. “Docile? What are you planning to do, you twisted pervert?” he chuckles, as Hyunjin runs a hand through his hair, pulling his head back slightly. Felix is beautiful. Like a wild animal suddenly caged, his resistance is part of his allure. How long will it take to break him? Maybe a lifetime wouldn’t be enough—or maybe he’s closer to breaking than Hyunjin thinks.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hyunjin presses his nose against Felix’s cheek. Felix’s hands move to grip Hyunjin’s shoulders. “Today, the clients voted for a very special reward.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“What kind of reward?” Felix mutters.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“The reward of watching you act... the reward of seeing you lose another fragment of innocence.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“I’m not innocent at all,” Felix frowns.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“You’ve never been with a man before. That alone makes you innocent in their eyes.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix says nothing. Hyunjin’s breath is calm, almost comforting, and it starts to feel like the sweetest, most seductive thing in the world to Felix. He wants to be consumed by it. He wants to feel it all around him. His eyes flutter shut as he sways forward.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">“They paid to see you use your mouth.”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Felix laughs, completely devoid of any negative thoughts, free from worry. He feels so good that he wishes the drug's effects would never end. His face lights up with a wide grin, freckles decorating his skin as his nose scrunches up. "Oh yeah? Those disgusting pervs want me to suck on a dildo while they jerk off like maniacs? I can do that."</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hyunjin breathes slowly, lips parting slightly as if he’s about to speak, but the words don’t come. For a moment, it seems like he either doesn’t want to say anything or doesn’t know how to respond. Felix notices the hesitation, narrowing his eyes in confusion. “What is it?”</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Hyunjin blinks as if snapping out of a trance. He shifts slightly, his hand that had been resting on Felix’s cheek moves, and his thumb brushes against Felix's bottom lip. Their eyes lock.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">"Who said anything about a dildo? You're going to use your mouth on me."</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin left him naked, unable to move, still groggy from the narcotic, pressed against the floor like an animal. Felix is so cold that all he can do is shiver. At least half an hour passes before he's able to slightly move his arms and legs again. Only then does he notice that the clothes he was wearing are gone, but his jailer hasn't brought him any new ones. He scoots back against the wall, never lifting himself off the ground; his legs are still too weak to hold him. Hugging his arms to his chest, the shivers wrack his body, the kind that come from anxiety and despair, gnawing at him like a trapped rat inside his ribcage. Felix rests his head on his knees, his lips forming a prayer, but there's no God to hear him—not even that self-proclaimed false god who toys with him like a puppet. In that moment, Felix recalls the sole of his shoe pressing against his soft sex. The disgust is so strong he could rip it out with his bare hands just to deny the memory of it.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix's ears are on high alert, listening intently. He knows Hyunjin could arrive at any moment. Before their last encounter, he never truly feared him, but now, he fully understands the massive gap between them. Hyunjin can literally crush him, and Felix has no weapon to defend himself—not even his own body. He underestimated the situation he’s in, that much is clear. But now that things have become painfully obvious, what should he do? Should he succumb to fear, become a slave to it? No. Not him.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">When the footsteps echo through the corridor, Felix's heart starts racing. His arms wrap tightly around his bent legs, trying to shield his nakedness from the view of his captor, who now stands in front of the cell. It's an image Felix is starting to get used to. Hyunjin sets up a tripod, a GoPro camera attached to it. What does he intend to do? Film him? Hyunjin hasn't said a word yet, but Felix can already sense that things are taking an even darker turn.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“So this is your grand plan. You drug me, strip me, and now you want to film me? Do you need material to threaten me?” Felix asks, his voice a hiss despite the sharpness of his words.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Threaten you?” Hyunjin replies, raising an eyebrow. He doesn’t look at Felix, not directly. The captor’s eyes are on the display, fingers moving over it, pressing here and there. “Do you really think I don’t know you, Felix? I know you don’t have a dime to your name.”</p>

<p class="p1"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix bites his lower lip. That bastard has really done his research on him? Yes, he had mentioned reading a certain “file,” but thinking back, Felix had dismissed it. What kind of file could the Korean police have on him? He had only been in the country for three months and had never had any trouble with the law.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“So what’s the plan? Send a video of me trapped to my family, asking for a ransom?” Felix presses, trying to understand why that damned tripod is aimed at him during one of the most vulnerable moments of his entire life.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin just laughs in response. “Do you even think before you speak? I just told you I know everything about you. Send a video to your family? Ask for a ransom? Please. Your parents don’t give a fuck about you, and even if they did, they’re too messed up to scrape together a dime. Your dad’s a crack addict, right? And your mom hasn’t been sober since 2012. No, no. I’m not filming you to extort money from that mess you still call family.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix stays silent. His brain buzzes with what he just heard. Shit. This guy really knows him; he has actually done research on him and his parents, who live in Australia? How did he manage that?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Why are you investigating me? Why haven’t I been allowed to see a lawyer yet?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“You don’t need a lawyer; you have me,” Hyunjin says with an angelic smile on his face. “Aren’t you happy? You finally have someone in your life who cares, who knows who you are. You can’t say the same about your friends, can you? They turned their backs on you at the first opportunity.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin brushes his fingertips against the bars. Felix finds that gesture hypnotic. He follows the fingertip sliding slowly against the metal. “You have no one outside of here. No one gives a damn that you’re missing. The only ones wondering where you are are the loan sharks you owe money to. Your life is so miserable that it’s an insult to call it that. Ending up trapped down here is the best thing that ever happened to you, Felix. Maybe you don’t realize it yet, but soon it will be obvious to you too.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Fuck you, you’re a psychopath! You must have hit your head really hard when you were a kid!” Felix growls, beside himself with anger.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Ah. I thought I had explained that I don’t like that kind of attitude. Perhaps I wasn’t clear enough? You really don’t want to make me angry. Now, come here.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix hesitates. He wants to assert himself, deny him everything, make it difficult for him to even get close, but he has no power. He fears the consequences of his disobedience. So he approaches the bars. His mind is always active, always alert. If a single opportunity for escape presents itself, he will seize it without hesitation; that’s obvious. But for now, it’s much better to play along. If his captor wants obedience, he’ll get it. Maybe, Felix thinks, if he trusts him, if he believes he has broken him, then he will lower his guard. This is his best chance. No, actually, it’s his only chance.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Reach your hands through the bars—no, not like that. Try to get both wrists through the same bars. Good. No sudden movements, understood? I don’t want to hear you scream because I had to break a few bones.” Hyunjin says this with such a light tone that it sends chills down Felix’s spine because he has no idea if he could actually do something like that, but at the same time, he suspects he would be perfectly capable of it.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">A pair of handcuffs snaps around his wrists. The weight of the metal makes them drop slightly. By now, his few muscles have completely stopped cooperating. “In your fucking video, didn’t I look like your prisoner enough yet?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“In my fucking video, you didn’t look like a prisoner enough,” Hyunjin repeats with a smile. “Now back up against the wall.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix looks at Hyunjin with disdain but then obeys the order. It doesn’t take many steps to press his back against the damp wall. This place is small. Far from a palace.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Satisfied?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin doesn’t respond but pulls out a small remote control.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Do you know what this is?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Do I look like a fortune teller?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin takes a deep breath, trying to summon the little patience he has left. “Last night, I drugged you. No, I don’t mean when I cleaned you up, I mean before that.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix breathes slowly, his head spinning inside his skull. He has no memory! Is that guy lying? Or is he telling the truth?!</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Bullshit.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I have no reason to lie to you,” Hyunjin insists.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix remains silent, his gaze drifting to that damn remote control. It’s clear that it has something to do with what his captor just said... but what?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I have to admit,” Hyunjin says calmly, "I like you a lot more when you're completely high. You're so condescending, so needy. But as I've already told you, drugging you so much is not good for your body."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix’s face burns with embarrassment. On one hand, he wants to know what happened while he was under the influence, but on the other, he fears finding out. Perhaps not having any memory is for the best. In fact, it’s definitely better that his mind has erased any recollection of those moments.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Stop playing games with me and tell me what the hell you’re filming me for.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Today we're going to play a game. The game is called 'submissive.' I'll explain the rules of the game. I'm now going into the cage, and you won't move a single finger while I enter. You won't try to run or reach the door. Got it?"</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">No fucking way! Felix thinks.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Got it."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Good."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin inserts the keys into the lock. Clank. The door opens slightly, and Felix rushes forward with all the desperate strength he has in his body, but Hyunjin presses the button on the remote control, and Felix crashes to the ground, panting. A shock of pure pleasure starts from within him, shaking him suddenly, making his sex hard in an instant. Something was vibrating deep inside his body. He gasps again, widens his eyes at Hyunjin, who releases the button and enters the cell, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Surprise. What’s that look on your face? You were so eager to try it when I first put it inside you…”.</p>

<p class="p1">That bastard.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">It's the only thought racing through Felix's mind as Hyunjin speaks. His arms tremble as they strain, trying to lift the weight of his body even slightly off the ground. If looks could kill, Felix’s jailer would already be dead. Behind those dark irises burns a hatred thick as tar.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"When...?" Felix's voice comes out in a breathy rasp.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin's lips curl into a smile as he places his fingers under Felix’s chin, lifting his face—again, again, and again. Every time Hyunjin does that, Felix feels more vulnerable, more powerless. Sure, he could resist, but it’s an illusion. The truth is, there’s nothing he can really do.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Does it matter? Would it change anything?"</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"I want to know how many times I've been unconscious around you."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Almost never," Hyunjin whispers. "Your consciousness was just... altered. Free from your mind's inhibitions. More pure, more genuine."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Bullshit," Felix snarls. "How could it be genuine if I wasn't even aware?"</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Have you ever thought that maybe you don’t know what you want?"</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"You must be a pathetic excuse for a manipulator if you think you can convince me &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; is what I want," Felix snaps, slamming his manacled wrists against the floor. The sound of metal echoes throughout the room.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin pulls his hand away from Felix's chin. Standing up, he takes a few steps toward the camera. For a moment, he says nothing, then turns back toward Felix, a strange uncertainty in his eyes. It’s as if he’s unsure of something. Felix would give anything to know what weaknesses lie beneath Hyunjin's armor—what cracks could shatter that facade. But all he can do is use his mind, sharpen his wit, and figure it out.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix realizes this is a chess game, and right now, he’s fighting with a single pawn against Hyunjin’s entire army.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Your stupid game—what’s that camera got to do with it?" Felix shoots a glance at the GoPro.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin hesitates for a second. Once again, something seems to make him uncertain. Finally, he slowly steps back, leaving the cage. Felix follows his movements, confused. The worst part is that Hyunjin seems to know exactly what his next move is; it's just Felix who can’t predict it.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Today, someone will be with us... connected remotely," Hyunjin begins, and those words send shivers down Felix’s spine. "They’ve paid a lot to be here with us today, so it’s important not to disappoint them. Now... if you weren’t so arrogant and combative, things would be simpler," Hyunjin explains as he pulls something from his pocket—a thick red satin ribbon, at least 10 centimeters wide and half a meter long. "But I can’t let you ruin the live stream. And even though I’ll explain how this game works in a bit, I know for sure you might not obey. So, I need to take some... extra measures, let’s say."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix stays silent. It’s too much new information to process. What does it mean that someone will see him? What does it mean that they paid a lot to *watch him*? What does it mean that his captor will have to take extra measures? But most importantly… how is it possible for certain things to happen in a prison? No, of course, in any prison in the world, such things wouldn’t be possible.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix’s mind begins to clear.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">He has no memory of his arrest. He’s never seen anyone in this prison except the guy who’s now opening a stool and positioning it behind the GoPro, out of its view. He hasn’t even heard the voices of other guards or prisoners. He’s never seen a lawyer, never even heard his charges. Now that he thinks about it, he doesn’t even have a prison uniform. And this cell… there are no windows, terrible humidity… Besides, even though the bars are thick and securely anchored in the floor and ceiling, it doesn’t seem like an elaborate cell. It almost looks like… a DIY job.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Now Felix really starts to feel fear.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">What if he’s not in a prison at all? What if his dealing activities have nothing to do with his captivity? What if that guy in the police uniform is just an impostor? Maybe he’s not an officer at all. In fact, Felix is almost sure he isn’t, and that this place is nothing more than the basement of his house at best, or the basement of an isolated warehouse at worst. Maybe that guy drugged him, kidnapped him, and brought him here. Maybe? No, those possibilities aren’t possibilities anymore. It’s definitely the case. He’s been kidnapped, drugged, and now the guy wants to film him and sell the footage of his captivity and humiliation to old perverts who will watch the whole thing.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">This makes Hyunjin more psychopathic, more mentally ill, but above all… more dangerous. If Felix’s entire life is in that guy’s hands, if no one else knows he’s there, if the only reason he’s still alive is that his captor hasn’t grown tired of him yet…</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Then everything changes.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix breathes slowly. His heart pounds in his chest. A new sense of fear washes over him. The most irrational part of him keeps hoping those ideas are just paranoia, but the rational part knows he can’t be too wrong. This situation isn’t normal. It’s impossible that he’s in jail.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Saying it out loud, would it help him or make things worse? </p>

<p class="p1">Felix doesn’t know how Hyunjin might react. </p>

<p class="p1">He doesn’t even know how much he can afford to lose his cool. </p>

<p class="p1">On one hand, he wants to scream and raise hell, but on the other hand, he thinks… will this end up harming me? </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I’d have preferred you drugged me this time instead of leaving me sober,” Felix whispers. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin blinks slowly. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I can do that if that’s really what you want.” </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix lowers his head. His messy blonde hair covers his forehead. Yes. Whatever is about to happen, he knows he wouldn’t be able to handle it sober. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Then do it,” Felix almost spits, sharp. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Oh, what a nasty tone. Is that how you ask for a favor?” </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix bites his lips hard enough to taste blood. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Please.” </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin smirks. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Alright, then.” </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin returns to the cell. This time, Felix doesn’t even try to attack him—he already knows it wouldn’t make sense. Hyunjin kneels beside him, and Felix lifts his face before Hyunjin can even touch him. For a second, just one, Felix sees surprise in Hyunjin's eyes. Then, arrogance takes the place of shock. “I could almost get used to having you so docile.” </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin pulls a vial from his pocket. He twists off the cap and presses his thumb and index finger against Felix’s cheeks. “Open your mouth. It’s a bit bitter when it’s not diluted with water, but—” </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix doesn’t even wait for Hyunjin to finish speaking. He opens his mouth, and Hyunjin falls silent as he pours drops onto his tongue. Felix squeezes his eyes shut, praying for that damned drug to take effect quickly. He doesn’t want to feel, doesn’t want to know, doesn’t want to perceive, and above all, doesn’t want to remember even a second of what’s about to happen. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“It won’t be as strong as last time, I already told you, right? Your body is starting to get used to this drug, and increasing the dose wouldn’t be safe.” </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">You should have given it to me less often, bastard! Felix thinks, but stays silent. His head begins to feel lighter. He experiences such dizziness that he feels his head sway side to side. Hyunjin’s hands become gentle, cradling the back of his neck before Felix can accidentally bang it against the wall. </p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">When Hyunjin speaks again, he does so in a low voice. That soft tone seems to echo in Felix’s mind like a reverberation.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I know this drug will make you calmer, but I can’t trust you just yet, you know? One day I might, but not today,” Hyunjin's hands massage his scalp. Felix feels Hyunjin's fingers running through his hair, and that alone is enough to completely relax his body. Even the tension between his legs, long ignored, begins to fade. “I can’t let you speak. And trust me, it’s a real shame because our guests would love to hear the sound of your voice… Now I’m going to blindfold your mouth. And you’ll be good and won’t resist. Understand?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix nods slowly. Has his captor always had such a gentle touch? Why do those hands feel so good all of a sudden? He feels safer than he ever has. How could he have thought he couldn’t trust this man? When he’s the only one in the world who can take care of him? Felix reaches for his face, but Hyunjin steps back before Felix can kiss him. He laughs softly, and it’s the most beautiful sound Felix has ever heard. “You’re already completely out of it, it’s incredible…”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Your name,” Felix whispers. “You didn’t tell me your name,” he mumbles, sounding as petulant as a child.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“But I did tell you. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix shakes his head slowly.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Hyunjin.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Hyunjin,” Felix repeats. Even his name is beautiful. “Are you a prince, Hyunjin?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin laughs again, and Felix smiles back, lowering his eyelids until he closes his eyes. How wonderful it would be to say only things that could elicit that sweet sound from Hyunjin. Not even the most beautiful symphony could compare to that sound. Felix lifts his hands and grabs Hyunjin's uniform, gripping it tightly, his fingers brushing against the badge, and something interrupts that bliss for a moment.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">It’s not cold, he thinks. It’s not metal. Is it plastic? Something tells him it’s important, but then he wonders, why should it be? It’s just a stupid pin.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin pulls out the red ribbon and begins wrapping it around Felix's mouth. Felix lets out a small whimper as Hyunjin leans in close enough to whisper in his ear. “You promised you’d be good, remember?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">No, Felix doesn’t remember that. But Hyunjin is so nice to him that he would never do anything to upset him. So he nods.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I’m not just going to blindfold you because I want to give you a gift. You always say you love watching me. Today, you’ll be able to watch me the whole time. Are you happy?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix’s eyes widen in astonishment. He gets to watch Hyunjin? He doesn’t even know what that means exactly, yet he feels like the luckiest man on the face of the earth.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">At that moment, Hyunjin does something that almost makes Felix's heart burst in his chest. He places his lips on Felix's forehead, and Felix is simply overwhelmed by his emotions. Love, affection, need—all of it floods through him. Tears prick at his eyes, and he wishes Hyunjin would place his lips everywhere. He would give anything for a kiss from him, he thinks. Then Hyunjin pulls away, and immediately, Felix feels the ache of wanting him close again. The absence of his warmth is unbearable, especially now that he is naked.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin stands up and walks slowly out of the cage. He doesn't even bother to close the door. Felix knows he would never escape, not now, at least. His mind is completely tangled. He sits on the stool, then hovers his thumb over the recording button on the GoPro, but he doesn't press it yet.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">He looks at Felix one last time.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p3">Felix’s blonde hair is disheveled, his body naked, covered in bruises. His spread legs reveal a reddened erection touching his belly, and his arms closed in a pair of handcuffs demonstrate his complete submission. And that gaze, directed at Hyunjin behind the GoPro, seems almost aimed at the viewers. Today, thirty wealthy Korean men will be watching. The waiting list to secure one of those thirty spots has been ridiculously long. Fools, he thinks.</p>

<p class="p4"> </p>

<p class="p3">"Let the show begin," he whispers, and then, finally, presses Play.</p>

<p class="p1">Felix is pulled from his dreams by the violent sound of something banging against the metal bars. It is that sharp noise that pierces his head, bringing him back to reality and erasing any comforting images that may have lulled him to sleep. Wherever he was just moments ago, it is clear that he is no longer there. He is back in the cell.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">The nails scratch against the dusty floor as his cheek presses against the concrete. Felix has a headache and is so tired that even getting up from the floor seems like a useless waste of energy. He breathes slowly and steadily, seeing Hyunjin's silhouette standing beyond the bars. He recognizes the figure but can't focus on it. He is too tired. He wonders when he will finally be able to get out of there, but a doubt begins to creep in: perhaps it is not so certain that he will see the sunlight again. That chaotic silence is interrupted by Hyunjin's voice.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"The sleeping beauty has finally awakened."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin addresses him as if everything is a fun game, as if they had both agreed to this situation. Now, following some invisible yet clear and present unspoken rules, they find themselves entangled. The reality, however, is very different. Felix has no idea what awaits him, and the doubt starts to gnaw at him to the point that even Hyunjin no longer seems such an important variable in that equation.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">That sarcastic tone has no effect on Felix, not today. He is too tired, too on edge to react. Crouched on the floor, his gaze begins to lose its sharpness, its vigor. Hyunjin, who just a moment ago was smirking, now has a more serious expression on his face. “You are starting to dehydrate. I brought you some fresh water. C’m here.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">That word ignites Felix. His palms now press against the dusty floor, he pushes himself up, but his body aches at every joint. Ignoring any complaints from his muscles, he drags himself over to the bars. His lips and mouth are dry, and he doesn’t say a single word. He reaches out his hands and waits for Hyunjin to hand him the cup. When it is offered, he grabs it. It is cold and made of metal. Felix empties the contents in a few sips. The cool water rushes down his throat. He could drink ten more cups and still not feel satisfied. He offers the empty cup back to Hyunjin.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I am still thirsty,” he complains.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Now that he has had some water, it feels as if his body suddenly remembers just how much it needs it, and he wonders if the headache that has been accompanying him for hours is due to the lack of fluids he has received in these days. In fact, he cannot recall having eaten or drunk anything, nor even having gone to the bathroom, which is quite impossible. He is a prisoner, sure, but he is still human. That question weighs heavily on his mind, yet the need to obtain what he requires to survive in this moment overshadows the natural human hunger for knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin takes the cup and flips it upside down. A drop of water falls and splashes onto the floor. “Your words have returned, huh?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">When Felix speaks again, he does so slowly, each word falling from his tongue one after the other, his throat hoarse, sharpening his already deep voice. “Stop being an asshole. You are making me die of thirst… This is torture.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Torture, you say?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Are you really that stupid not to realize it yourself? Even dogs are not treated this way.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix grips the bars with his hands. His fingers clutch the metal until his knuckles turn white. “Do you want me to beg for more water? Are you sick to that point?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“It would surprise you to discover how sick I can be,” Hyunjin says, his expression resembling that of a feline during the hunt. Felix presses against the bars to stand straighter.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I’m dying of thirst, you bastard.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I can’t possibly give you any more,” Hyunjin replies calmly.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“What the fuck are you talking about?!”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Don’t misunderstand; I get no pleasure from watching you wither like a plant forgotten in the sun. It’s just that… if I gave you any more, we would exceed the doses.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix feels a chill of dismay.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“The doses?” Felix raises an eyebrow, confused.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I had to drug the water, so when it takes effect, I can enter the cell. So… Do you understand that if I gave you more, we would exceed the recommended doses? I would never want anything bad to happen to you.” A wicked grin. Felix feels like he’s spiraling downwards.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“You’re messing with me,” he says, restless. “You just want to scare me. There was nothing in the water!”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Just because you don’t feel the effects now doesn’t mean it won’t happen very soon. Why don’t you sit tight and wait? Soon you’ll start to feel your arms and legs go numb, and in five minutes, it will be impossible for you to move. That will be when I enter the cage.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin speaks with a cold, almost surgical calmness, as though he’s listing the standard procedures required for a specific action. He pulls out the large key from his pocket and inserts it into the lock of the cell. Felix prepares to spring forward the moment the key clicks in the lock, already imagining himself slamming into the door, knocking Hyunjin down the corridor, and sprinting desperately toward the stairs. Then, the key clicks.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">But despite willing every muscle in his body to react, Felix realizes with growing horror that he cannot move. His mind is sharp, but his body refuses to respond.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"I've had you drugged completely until now," Hyunjin explains with chilling calmness as he kneels down. His long, cold fingers press under Felix’s chin, forcing his head up. Felix glares at him with hatred, wanting to spit in his face or curse him out, but he can’t move a single muscle—not even his tongue. He’s utterly helpless.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"But you've been here long enough, and continuing with that much sedative wouldn't have done you any good. Though, perhaps it would've been better for you."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin brushes his nose against Felix's, a cruel smirk playing on his lips.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Now, I’m going to strip you down. You stink."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix's eyes widen in fear as Hyunjin's words sink in. His heart races, pounding against his ribcage like a caged animal desperate to escape.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“This bastard is gonna rape me”, Felix thinks this as terror sharpens inside him, so intense that he wouldn’t be surprised if something started to bleed within. Hyunjin’s hands grip his now filthy shirt, lifting it to expose his chest, where faintly defined muscles are covered in a sticky layer of sweat and grime.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin's fingers trail down Felix's neck, sending shivers of revulsion through his paralyzed form.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"You're trembling like a little lamb. Are you that scared of the big bad wolf?”.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">As if the situation weren't already unbearable, Hyunjin keeps mocking him. The guard's hands grip Felix's shoulders, pushing him down until his back slams against the floor. The sharp pain from the impact makes him want to scream, but no sound escapes his throat. Meanwhile, Hyunjin yanks at his lower clothes, exposing him completely. Stripped bare, Felix has never felt so vulnerable in his life.</p>

<p class="p1"><br />
Felix's breath comes in short, shallow gasps as he lies naked and exposed on the cold, hard floor. His mind races, desperately searching for a way out of this nightmare, but with Hyunjin's imposing figure looming over him, escape seems impossible.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin's eyes rake over Felix's bare form, a twisted smile playing on his lips. "You know, you’re kinda pretty when you are that scared. I bet you'd do just about anything right now to make me stop, wouldn't you?”.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix's breath catches in his throat as he feels the guard's weight settle on top of him, pinning him even more effectively to the floor. Hyunjin's knees press into the sensitive skin of his inner thighs, forcing his legs apart and exposing him utterly.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix's eyes widen in horror as he realizes Hyunjin's intent, his body instinctively recoiling from the guard's touch. But with his arms trapped beneath Hyunjin's weight and his legs forced apart, there's nowhere for him to go.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin's eyes lock with Felix's, a cruel smile playing on his lips as he slowly, deliberately presses the heel of his shoe against Felix's soft, exposed cock. Felix gasps, his body jerking involuntarily at the contact, his eyes squeezing shut in humiliation and shame.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Look at me," Hyunjin commands, his voice low and dangerous. "I want to see your face as I do this. Until now, we’ve been playing,” Hyunjin says, his voice low and serious. “But I’m done with your little bratty attitude. Your life, your body, your mind... it’s all in my hands. Everything. I am your God, Felix. Whether you live or die, it’s my decision. Whether you eat or drink, that’s up to me. Even whether you breathe... it’s my decision.” With those words, Hyunjin leans over Felix’s body, his hand tightening around his throat while his foot presses harder between Felix’s legs. “I had to drug you to stop getting shitty responses to everything I say. This is all your fault.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">The tension is so thick that Felix feels like he’s going to lose his mind. His heart pounds wildly in his chest, but it’s the anxiety that makes it race so fast. Only now does he fully realize how dangerous, how lethal, the boy guarding his cell truly is. A question surges in his mind: why has no one else shown up in this prison? He’s never seen or heard anyone else, except for Hyunjin. He wants to speak, but he can't. His questions remain locked inside him, like a hurricane tearing apart what little sanity he still has left.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin’s foot plays with his sensitivity, and Felix is completely helpless, unable to move even a muscle to defend himself. Then, without warning, Hyunjin pulls away from him, leaves the cell, and returns with a bucket and a damp cloth. He begins to wipe Felix’s body clean, scrubbing away the filth. Panic starts to fade with each gentle swipe of the cloth against his skin, and slowly, Felix starts to believe the moment of danger has passed. Or maybe he just needs to believe it, to keep himself from going completely insane.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin tosses the cloth into the bucket, then stands up, his hand gripping the handle. “I’ll be back in a couple of hours” he announces, not even bothering to meet Felix’s eyes. The cell door slams shut, the dull sound echoing through the silence. Then, without another word, Hyunjin ascends the stairs and disappears, just as he came.</p>

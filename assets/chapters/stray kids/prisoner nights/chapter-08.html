<p class="p1">"Who said anything about a dildo? You're going to use your mouth on me."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix tenses at Hyunjin’s words. His heart begins to race, a sudden fear creeping over him. He still feels dizzy, light, and confused, but the warm, honey-like sensation of love that had filled him the last time Hyunjin drugged him is no longer there. It’s true, then. The more he takes, the weaker the effect becomes.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"On you?" Felix asks, his voice trembling slightly.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin nods, his thumb pressing lightly against the corner of Felix's mouth, tugging the skin gently. "I know it's not easy. But I promise, if you're good, you'll get something much better than fried chicken and beer. Remember what I told you? I can make this place somewhere you actually want to live, somewhere better than out there."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">What choice does Felix have but to trust him? It feels natural to place his trust in the hands of someone who is caressing him so gently. Hyunjin... as the drug clouds Felix’s mind, he starts to think it might be better to have Hyunjin as a friend rather than an enemy. Maybe they are already accomplices in this, after all. And hasn't he always thought Hyunjin was beautiful? Would it really be a problem for him to get down on his knees and give him pleasure?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">None of those thoughts would exist if his body weren't under the influence of the pill, but Felix is too far gone to realize it. He convinces himself of a series of lies, each of which makes him feel better. It makes him feel safe, almost protected. It leads him to believe that, deep down, it's Hyunjin who is protecting him.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">He nods slowly. Hyunjin kisses his forehead, and Felix's heart starts to race even more. He feels warmth on his face, and that warmth spreads everywhere. Why are Hyunjin's kisses so sweet? It's unfair.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"I have to go start the livestream now. In the meantime, you'll need to strip. I’ll also have to put chains on your wrists," he says. Felix looks down at his hands and realizes that the handcuffs are gone. When did Hyunjin take them off? Once again, his memory has gaps he can't explain. "But if you're good, as I expect you to be, I'll take them off again once we're done."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin's hand glides against Felix's neck. The light touch makes Felix's skin tingle, and he sighs. Then, Hyunjin helps him sit on the floor, ensuring that Felix won't tumble down as soon as he steps away. Only after that does he assist in undressing him, then secures his wrists in a pair of heavy handcuffs. “You will refer to me in only one way, if necessary — <em>master</em>. You must not call me by any other name, understood?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix nods slowly. He feels a buzzing in his ears, along with a sense of discomfort spreading in his chest. “The drug doesn’t—”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“I know,” Hyunjin whispers. “But you can handle it.”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix believes him. He can't help but trust every word that comes from those lips. When Hyunjin steps away, he almost feels the urge to reach out and grab him to prevent it. However, Hyunjin is already far away before that thought solidifies in Felix's mind. Once outside the cell, Hyunjin starts the recording and, just like the last time, welcomes the online guests and explains what he is about to do. Before entering the cell, he puts on a Scream mask.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1"><em>He protects his identity</em> —Felix thinks, a simple and obvious thought that weighs heavily on him. It will only be him losing face once again. It should feel natural, yet this realization hurts so much that he feels a lump tightening in his throat.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin enters the cell. The way he walks and moves is very different from before. He is confident but also arrogant. His face is concealed, but every fiber of his being seems to exude a boldness that is foreign to Felix. Is this part of his character? Felix watches Hyunjin closely. When he stands in front of him, Hyunjin's hand plunges back into Felix's hair, but this time there's no gentleness at all. He pulls on Felix's strands, tugging hard enough to hurt.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Some of you doubted it was possible, yet look. The prisoner obeys me. In fact, he’s even devoted to me,” Hyunjin yanks Felix's hair so forcefully that Felix is compelled to lift his face completely, forcing the pain against his scalp to subside. "And despite his innocence, now he will suck my cock and swallow my semen without uttering a single complaint."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix narrows his eyes. The pain makes the corners of his eyelids twitch. Hyunjin releases his grip on his hair and slowly unzips his pants, then lowers his boxers enough to reveal his erection. It's long and thick, more red at the tip. The scent of Hyunjin seems even more concentrated at that point. Felix feels a bit dazed by the intensity of the moment. It seems like he's trapped in a lucid dream.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Open your mouth and suck the cock, Felix," this time Hyunjin's tone is lower, softer.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix stretches his hands towards Hyunjin's erection. His fingers tremble, but his mind tries to recall the moments when he himself has received a blowjob. He has no idea what to do, how to do it. But then he thinks that, after all, it's not necessary for his blowjob to be amazing — it's not Hyunjin he needs to impress, but a series of perverts who are watching that scene with their hands already in their pants.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix opens his mouth. His tongue approaches Hyunjin's glans, licking it slowly and feeling a sigh escape behind the mask. That thing gives him courage. He moves his tongue with a slow and long circular motion, then wraps his soft lips around the glans. Lets it slide gently into his mouth, and once again, his head spins. The idea of sucking a cock... of sucking Hyunjin's cock... is all so strange that his movements slow down. When Hyunjin's hand stops again between his hair, Felix resumes sliding that big cock into his mouth, before the other starts pulling his hair painfully again. He hollows his cheeks, the shaft is now halfway in. His mouth has never been so full. The deeper he goes, the more rivulets of saliva slip away from the corners of his lips.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Amazing. It seems like he was born to suck cock. Look at him. He didn't hesitate for even a second," Hyunjin whispers. The other hand reaches Felix's head as well. Both hands rest gently on his face, and for a moment, it seems like a soft caress. "Now you will let me fuck your mouth. I will push all the way to the back of your throat and you must never retreat, not even when you run out of breath. Not even when I fill you with cum. Is that clear?"</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix raises his glassy-eyed gaze. His knees pressed against the floor begin to hurt, it's uncomfortable and he doesn't like not being able to see Hyunjin's face or be spoken to in that way... he nods. He doesn't want to upset him, doesn't want to hinder him. He just wants it to all be over quickly.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin's grip on Felix's head tightens. Hyunjin sways his hips with determination and delivers the first decisive thrust into Felix's mouth. Felix almost chokes - Hyunjin's glans forces its way down his throat without hesitation or scruple. It pushes all the way in, claiming all the space it needs to bury itself in him. Another thrust, and then another. Felix squints his eyes, tears welling up from the effort of taking it. Every thrust drives Hyunjin deeper, and then even deeper, and after a few thrusts, Felix can feel the pubic hair of Hyunjin against his lips.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">"Fuck... you're incredible. It <em>really</em> seems like you were born for this." And this time, Hyunjin's words are a whisper that only Felix can hear. His cheeks flush, but most of all, that compliment and adulation make Felix want to receive more of it. Felix wavers his tongue against the shaft, eliciting a new gasp from Hyunjin who, at that point, starts thrusting with an unsustainable rhythm. Felix is out of breath.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin relentlessly fucks Felix's mouth with an insatiable intensity. The camera captures every fragment of that scene, the scene of a young man held captive allowing his captor to use him as a hole, the scene of a young man bent by circumstances to the point of being used by the man who holds his life and freedom in his hands. Hyunjin is fucking that warm, torrid mouth with such fervor that even his breathing is short. Felix feels like he's reaching a point of no return, it's as if the situation is starting to excite him... and in the end, that's really what's happening. The cock between his legs begins to harden with every possessive and authoritative thrust from Hyunjin. Then, suddenly, the dense, warm semen of the other man fills his throat, rises up his throat. Hyunjin presses his hands against the back of Felix's head to keep him glued to the cock, Felix can do nothing but swallow the semen while that erect shaft still fills his mouth and pushes to have one last access to his throat. Hyunjin's groan fades into silence. Then, without any grace, he pushes Felix away from him and shoves him towards the floor.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix bangs his elbow and groans in pain, his breathing labored, the taste of the boy's semen filling his mouth, his stomach, his brain. He feels completely wiped out, it's as if he's been electrocuted. He can't even fully comprehend what just happened.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Hyunjin adjusts his cock in his pants, zips it up, and bends down to Felix's level, at his knees. He grabs Felix's hair again, and Felix groans loudly in pain - the skin is irritated from the way Hyunjin pulled him earlier. "You should thank me," he whispers.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix stares at him disoriented, and so Hyunjin pulls his hair again. "Thank me."</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Th-Thank you,” Felix hesitates, confused.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Thank you <em>what</em>? How should you call me?”</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix's eyes widen. He shifts his gaze to the camera and then back to Hyunjin.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">His heart beats so fiercely in his chest that it feels like it might explode.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">What is happening?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Why has Hyunjin changed so much towards him?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Is this the real Hyunjin, or is the real Hyunjin the one he usually interacts with?</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">Felix bites his lower lip. The taste of Hyunjin lingers in his mouth.</p>

<p class="p2"> </p>

<p class="p1">“Thank you... master.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

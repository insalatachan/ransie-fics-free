<p>Hyunjin grips a heavy key tightly in his hands, striking it against each bar of Felix's cage. Sitting on the floor, Felix slowly raises his head to meet the gaze of his captor. How did he end up in this situation? Of course. He got caught. And as far as he knows, no one in this corrupt prison intends to formally report him. There won’t be any trial. This story won’t be resolved in a courtroom, but in another way. Money, perhaps? Yet by this point, they should have already asked him for it. Still, no one has ever mentioned that.</p>

<p>"What do you want from me?" Felix asks, his voice hoarse and sharp. He’s tired. He can’t even remember when he was thrown into this cell. Days, for sure. But has it already been a week? Or is he starting to lose his sense of time to the point where he can’t recognize it?</p>

<p>Hyunjin smirks pausing his rhythmic tapping on the bars. There’s something sadistic in the way a “tsk” escapes his lips. How can a boy with such a sweet face have such a harsh attitude?</p>

<p>“It’s not about what I want, Felix. In fact, I want nothing; I already have everything I need. You see, in a few hours, my shift in this shithole will be over, and I’ll be going home. You, on the other hand…” Hyunjin lets the sentence hang in the air. “What you should really be asking yourself is what you can do for me.”</p>

<p>Felix grits his teeth. If it weren’t for the bars separating them, he would jump him and start throwing punches, but he’s not in a position to act tough. “There’s very little I can do locked up in here, right?” he replies, dripping with sarcasm. It’s the only weapon he has left.</p>

<p>Hyunjin chuckles darkly, amused by Felix's biting remark. "Oh, I wouldn't say that. Even in your current... predicament, I'm sure there are plenty of things you could do for me. But let's not get ahead of ourselves." He pauses, letting his words sink in. "Tell me, Felix, have you ever heard the saying, 'You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar'?"</p>

<p>Felix narrows his eyes, suspicious of Hyunjin's intentions. "What's your point?"</p>

<p>"My point is that a little cooperation and a friendly attitude can go a long way in a place like this. You're not exactly in a position to be making enemies, now are you?" Hyunjin's voice drips with condescension, as if he's explaining something to a child.</p>

<p>Felix clenches his fists, trying to control his temper. "What do you want me to do? Kiss your feet and beg for mercy?"</p>

<p>Hyunjin laughs, a cold, cruel sound that echoes through the cell block. "That wouldn't be a bad start, but I think we can find something more... mutually beneficial. You're a resourceful guy, Felix. I'm sure you have skills that could be put to good use around here."</p>

<p>Felix's mind races, trying to figure out what Hyunjin could possibly want from him. "What kind of skills?"</p>

<p>Hyunjin's eyes glint with malice. "Oh, I don't know. Maybe you could start by telling me what you did to end up in here. I'm sure that story would be very... entertaining."</p>

<p>"Fuck you," Felix growls. "You know exactly why I'm locked up in here. Or is it that in your fucked-up organization, you’re so worthless that you’re kept in the dark about everything?"</p>

<p>Sweetness instead of vinegar. Sure, keep dreaming, fucking-guardboy.</p>

<p>Felix has no intention of losing his grip on himself just for the amusement of the asshole holding the keys to his freedom. "Admit it. You're just a loser stuck in a basement watching over little criminals like me. You’re worth nothing outside this moldy corridor. You just want to feel big, don’t you? Feel important, for once being in a position of power over someone else. A real loser."</p>

<p>Hyunjin's smirk fades, replaced by a cold, hard stare. He takes a step closer to the bars, his grip tightening on the key in his hand. "You really don't know when to keep your mouth shut, do you?" he hisses. "I was trying to be nice, give you a chance to make your life here a little easier. But if you want to play hardball, we can do that too."</p>

<p>Felix remains silent. His eyes pierce into Hyunjin's; neither is willing to look away. "I'm not afraid of you."</p>

<p>"You should be," Hyunjin threatens, and for a moment, just a moment, Felix realizes he actually is afraid. He’s afraid of this situation, of the man in front of him, of his intentions, and of his own future. He wonders if he will ever get out of this place. But where is he exactly? He has hazy memories of his capture—gaps in his mind that make it impossible to piece the puzzle together.</p>

<p>"The way I'm being held here is... completely illegal."</p>

<p>"Illegal?!" Hyunjin laughs. "Oh, come on. Now you're talking about legality, of all people? We’ve read your file, you know. It’s full of interesting tidbits."</p>

<p>"You’re well-informed for someone who doesn’t even know why the hell I’m locked up."</p>

<p>Hyunjin smirks.</p>

<p>"You’re so naïve, Felix. You almost make me feel sorry for you."</p>

<p>Felix doesn’t understand what Hyunjin means by that. He only feels that nothing the boy says is casual. Once again, a shiver runs down his spine.</p>

<p>"You're just a piece of shit!" Felix growls, lunging towards the bars. He reaches out to grab Hyunjin by the collar, but the boy steps back just in time. Felix is taken aback by the guard's reflexes. Almost no one usually outpaces him, but this time...</p>

<p>"Look, look, the little animal is trying to bite? I really don't like that. Oh, my poor, wounded heart. I think I’ll need some time to recover from this pathetic scene. Use the solitude to think about your awful temper."</p>

<p>Hyunjin smirks, amused and sadistic, as he slides the key into his jacket pocket.</p>

<p>Felix stares at him with wide eyes, bewildered. When Hyunjin starts to walk down the hallway toward the stairs, something inside Felix breaks, plunging him into panic.</p>

<p>"Where the hell are you going?! Hey, asshole! You can't leave me here!" But Felix's voice is just an echo swallowed by the silence of the place and by Hyunjin's footsteps as he ascends the stairs.</p>

<p>Felix screams in frustration and throws himself on the ground, his head in his hands.<br />
Why can’t he remember anything? Why does his memory seem compromised? How the hell did he end up in this place? Where are the other prisoners, or the other cells? Where the hell is the bureaucracy? All the mandatory steps that happen when the police take down a criminal?</p>

<p>He trembles from anger, cold, and exhaustion. Time begins to stretch again under the frayed threads of his perception. The light in the cell is always on. Always. Night and day blend with the same ease that hours and minutes do. He falls asleep and wakes up drenched in sweat, with a new part of his body aching from the hard floor pressing against his bones. The humidity seeps into his skin, into his lungs, making him cough. He feels dirty, hungry, thirsty. He’s losing clarity, his sanity. How long has he been locked up? How long? How long? How long?</p>
